## Version 2.1.0 Update

### New Features

- **Task Manager AI Handling**:
  - The Task Manager module now includes an intelligent query handler (`analyze_user_query`) that can:
    - Identify specific processes like "Google Chrome" and provide detailed resource usage.
    - Detect "suspicious" or high-resource-usage processes.
    - Respond to queries about the "top" CPU or memory-consuming processes.
    - Advise on whether to terminate a process based on its resource usage or criticality.
    - Provide a system health summary based on CPU, memory, and disk usage.

### How It Works

- The `analyze_user_query` method parses user input to identify intent (e.g., "Which process is using the most CPU?").
- It matches keywords like "Chrome," "suspicious," or "terminate" to provide targeted responses.

- For example, when asked about "Google Chrome," the method calculates:
  - Total CPU usage: `sum(p.get('cpu_percent', 0) for p in chrome_processes)`
  - Total memory usage: `sum(p.get('memory_percent', 0) for p in chrome_processes)`
- These calculations aggregate resource usage across all Chrome processes.

- CPU, memory, and disk usage percentages are evaluated:
  - Example: If `cpu_percent > 80`, the system is under heavy load.
- The method combines these metrics into a concise health summary.

- If no specific query is detected, the system defaults to listing processes sorted by CPU, memory, or creation time.

### Example Queries

- "Is Google Chrome running?"
- "Which process is using the most memory?"
- "Are there any suspicious processes?"
- "Should I terminate this process?"
- "How is my system performing?"

This update enhances Liam's ability to provide actionable insights into system performance and process management.

### Changes

- **Camera AI Vision Enhancements**:
  - The `CameraManager` now dynamically integrates AI Vision descriptions into Liam's responses.
  - AI Vision descriptions are processed and stored in real-time, enabling Liam to provide accurate and context-aware responses.
  - Improved error handling ensures Liam gracefully manages issues with the camera or AI Vision.
  - Added support for auto-narration, allowing Liam to describe what the camera sees periodically.
  - OCR functionality can now be toggled dynamically, enabling text recognition when needed.
  - Liam no longer relies on predefined keywords for camera-related queries, making interactions more natural and flexible.
